# CONFIGURATION FILE EXAMPLE

# Each config item should be written in its own line.
# Format: <key> = <value>
# Keys should not contain any whitespaces.

# All lines starting with # are comments.
# Empty lines are allowed to structure the document.

# Basic examples of different variable types
aBool   = 1
aString = Hello World
aDouble = 42.777
anInt   = 42

# Namespaces are just a prefix for the key
namespace.key1  = value1
namespace.key2  = value2
otherspace.key1 = 1
otherspace.key2 = 2
